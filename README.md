This repository contains 3 AI/machine learning related projects:

-A house prediction one that uses mean squared error as loss function. 

-An image prediction project (on cat, lion and dog image recognition) (without data, so may not be correct), that uses neural network theory.

-A student performance prediction project using a Decision Tree,random forest classifier, a linear model perceptron, linear model logistic regression, and a neural network based classifier.
